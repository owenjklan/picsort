**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

Do NOT assume that anything currently here works or will be "supported" by me in
any way. The intention is to make this usable for others in time but for now,
it is for a personal need and may _never_ become user-friendly.

**THIS IS ALSO A MESS**

This whole script in its current form is a "first-pass" effort
to sort out a bunch of files into zips. The code structures
is gross as no effort has been made to refactor as it's doing the job
I wanted it too.

Point is, if this is still present in the README, then judging coding ability
from this is a waste of time ;)

# picsort
Python utility to take a great big collection of image files and use EXIF data
to sort the images into directories based on year and month that the image was
taken.
